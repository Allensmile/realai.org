## Google

### Artificial Intelligence

Google’s AI efforts are brought together under [Google.ai](https://google.ai/), a site focused on bringing the benefits of AI to everyone. Google’s [TensorFlow Research Cloud](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfrc/) is a cluster of 1,000 [Cloud TPUs](https://cloud.google.com/tpu/) that support machine learning research for free. The Cloud TPUs are purpose-built for machine learning workloads, including both training and prediction, and each Cloud TPU deilvers up to 180 teraflops of performance. In contrast, [NVIDIA](http://realai.org/companies/nvidia/) claims its [Volta](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/volta-gpu-architecture/) GPU delivers over 100 teraflops. According to a Google [blog post](https://www.blog.google/topics/google-cloud/google-cloud-offer-tpus-machine-learning/), a machine learning supercomputer called “TPU pod” can be built with 64 TPUs to provide up to 11.5 petaflops of computation.

## Waymo

### Analyst's Opinions

Following its [recent deal](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/14/technology/lyft-waymo-self-driving-cars.html) with Lyft to collaborate on self-driving cars, Morgan Stanley's analyst Brian Nowak [wrote to clients around 23 May 2017](http://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/23/alphabets-self-driving-waymo-unit-could-be-worth-70-billion-more-than-gm-morgan-stanley-says.html) that as a potential spin-out candidate, Waymo could be worth $70 billion.
