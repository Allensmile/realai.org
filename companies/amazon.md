# Amazon.com, Inc.

## Business

According to a [TechCrunch article](https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/14/why-amazon-is-eating-the-world/), each piece of Amazon is built with a service-oriented architecture that can be turned into a separate platform opening to outside competition. It allows Amazon to quickly identify which piece of the company works and which doesn't.

### Smart Speaker

In May 2017, Amazon launched [Echo Show](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01J24C0TI), a new Alexa-powered speaker that includes a 7in touchscreen and video calling. Each costs $229.99 and will ship on June 28, 2017.

As of April 2017, [eMarketer estimates](https://www.emarketer.com/Article/Alexa-Say-What-Voice-Enabled-Speaker-Usage-Grow-Nearly-130-This-Year/1015812) that Amazon's Echo has 70.6% of the year's 35.6 million American users, followed by Google's 23.8% market share. eMarketer also expects Amazon's market share to fall slightly in the coming years.
