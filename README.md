# About Real AI

We believe that many of today's problems, such as poverty, disease, and global warming, can be solved by safe and general artificial intelligence (AI) built to benefit the world. At Real AI, we do our best to develop such intelligence. Our core activity is scientific research.

We are based in Hong Kong and are not profit-driven. Please contact [hr@realai.org](mailto:hr@realai.org) if you're interested in working with us.
