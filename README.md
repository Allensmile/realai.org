# About Real AI

We believe many of today's problems such as poverty, disease, and global warming, can be solved by a strong and general artificial intelligence (AI) developed to benefit the world. At Real AI, we do our best to bring this AI to reality as fast as possible. Our main activity is scientific research.

We are based in Hong Kong, currently looking for highly motivated individuals to work on pure research towards general AI. Legal work authorization is required. Interested candidates please send CV or self introduction to [hr@realai.org](mailto:hr@realai.org).
