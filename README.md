## AI and Society

Rapid [progress](http://realai.org/progress/) in artificial intelligence (AI) has raised the prospect that machines will [one day](http://realai.org/timing/) surpass humans in intelligence. Countries around the world have [policies](http://realai.org/policies/) in place to support AI research and development, [research groups](http://realai.org/labs/) are given a lot of resources, and many experts have already published [roadmaps](http://realai.org/roadmaps/) towards building artificial general intelligence (AGI).

AGI technology could represent the greatest change in the history of life on Earth. We can take steps to ensure that it is [safe and beneficial](http://realai.org/safety/).

## Research

The best place to appreciate AI’s progress is at its research frontiers. Unlike mature fields where many years of postgraduate training is needed, the [background](http://realai.org/curriculum/) for cutting-edge AI is accessible to college students, whose papers often appear in top academic [conferences](http://realai.org/conferences/).

Since 2012, deep learning ([Goodfellow et al., 2016](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/deep-learning); [LeCun et al., 2015](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v521/n7553/full/nature14539.html); [Schmidhuber 2014](https://arxiv.org/abs/1404.7828)) has achieved phenomenal success or shown great potential in many areas, e.g., vision, language, autonomous driving, [program induction](http://realai.org/program-induction/), [automated theorem proving](http://realai.org/automated-theorem-proving/), and [games](http://realai.org/games/). Although we still lack a deep [theoretical understanding](http://realai.org/deep-learning-theory/) of how this is accomplished, many systems have already been [implemented](http://realai.org/deep-learning-implementation/) in large-scale.

Presently, we focus on deep learning, an area in machine learning inspired by [neuroscience](http://realai.org/neuroscience/). Our focus will shift to [other areas](http://realai.org/frontiers/) if they show more promise towards AGI.

### Learning Architecture

A deep-learning architecture is a large and complex [network architecture](http://realai.org/network-architecture/) whose dynamics follow [learning rules](http://realai.org/learning-rules). In the architecture, there can be one or more neural networks, an agent, or [multiple agents](http://realai.org/multi-agent-learning/). Their learning can be cooperative or [adversarial](http://realai.org/adversarial-learning/). The neural networks are usually deep and hierarchical, sometimes [augmented with memory](http://realai.org/memory-augmented-neural-networks/), and can be automatically designed using [architecture search](http://realai.org/architecture-search/).

### Reinforcement Learning

In reinforcement learning ([Sutton & Barto, 2017](http://incompleteideas.net/sutton/book/the-book-2nd.html)), agents learn to maximize numerical rewards provided by an environment that is influenced by the agents' actions. Sophisticated [platforms](http://realai.org/reinforcement-learning-platforms/) have been built to simulate this process.
