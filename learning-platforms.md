# Learning Platforms

A learning platform is an environment in which an agent can observe, act, and learn. [DeepMind Lab](https://github.com/deepmind/lab) is a 3D learning environment based on the [Quake III Arena](https://github.com/id-Software/Quake-III-Arena). Facebook's [TorchCraft](https://github.com/TorchCraft/TorchCraft) is a bridge between Torch and StarCraft. Microsoft's [Project Malmö](https://github.com/Microsoft/malmo) is built on top of Minecraft. [VizDoom](https://github.com/mwydmuch/ViZDoom) is based on [ZDoom](https://github.com/rheit/zdoom) that allows AI bots to play using only the screen buffer.

On 15 February 2017, Microsoft [announced](https://blogs.microsoft.com/next/2017/02/15/microsoft-shares-open-source-system-training-drones-gadgets-move-safely/) the [Aerial Informatics and Robotics Platform](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/aerial-informatics-robotics-platform/), also known as AirSim ([Shah et al., 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.05065)). It is an [open-source](https://github.com/Microsoft/AirSim), high-fidelity physics and photo-realistic robot simulator that aims to narrow the gap between simulation and reality in order to aid development of autonomous vehicles.

[OpenAI Gym](https://gym.openai.com/) supports teaching agents everything from walking to playing games like Pong or Go. OpenAI's [Universe](https://universe.openai.com/) is a software platform for measuring and training AI acrosss many games, websites and other applications.

On 15 May 2017, Facebook [announced](https://code.facebook.com/posts/266433647155520/parlai-a-new-software-platform-for-dialog-research/) dialog research platform [ParlAI](https://github.com/facebookresearch/ParlAI) for training and testing dialog models across multiple tasks at once. Its first release included more than 20 public datasets covering question answering, sentence completion, goal-oriented dialog, chit-chat dialog and visual dialog.
