# Corporate Administration

## Governance

### Annual General Meeting

In general, a Hong Kong company must hold an annual general meeting (AGM) every year, but as a single member company, Real AI is [not required](http://www.cr.gov.hk/en/companies_ordinance/faq_meet-res-co-record.htm#03) to do so.

### Company Directors

The [Companies Registry](http://www.cr.gov.hk/en/home/index.htm) advise all directors to read this [Guide](http://www.cr.gov.hk/en/publications/docs/director_guide-e.pdf) on directors' duties.

### Company Secretary

A private Hong Kong company [must have](http://www.cr.gov.hk/en/faq/faq01.htm#022) a company secretary. Our company secretary is provided by [OneStart](http://www.onestartoffices.com/).

## Finance 

Real AI is looking for an accounting firm for annual audits and regularly compiling books of accounts. Please contact [Jonathan Yan](mailto:jyan@realai.org) for further details.
