# About Real AI

Many of todayâ€™s problems, such as poverty, disease, and climate change, can be solved by [safe](http://realai.org/frontier/safety.html) and general artificial intelligence (AI) built to benefit the world. On a smart planet that automatically produces goods and services, everyone will live well and prosper. At Real AI, we do our best to turn this vision into reality.

We are based in Hong Kong and are not for profit. Our long-term plan is to conduct original research, but limited by resources, we currently focus on monitoring worldwide development in the field of AI. Please contact [hr@realai.org](mailto:hr@realai.org) if you're interested in working with us. We are currently in urgent need of help on nonprofit administration and governance.
