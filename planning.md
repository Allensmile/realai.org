# Planning

[Hamrick et al. (2017)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.02670) introduced a metacontroller agent that included one or more experts as models of the environment. The agent minimized a combined loss of performance and resource by learning to query selected agents in a number of steps depending on the difficulty of the task. This framework was demonstrated in a one-shot task of firing the thruster of a spaceship to reach a target location in a simulated space of multiple planets whose gravitational force affected the spaceship.
