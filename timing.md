## Expert Predictions

### Geoffrey E. Hinton

[Geoffrey Hinton](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/) predicted in a [Guardian report](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/may/21/google-a-step-closer-to-developing-machines-with-human-like-intelligence) on 21 May 2015 that computers would have developed "common sense" within a decade. In that report, "reasoning and logic" were understood as part of common sense. In an [O'Reilly report](https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/adapting-ideas-from-neuroscience-for-ai) published on 28 March 2017, he said it might take longer than 10 years to develop systems that surpass people in areas like "reasoning and learning from a very small number of examples."

### Jürgen Schmidhuber

During the [Beneficial AI 2017](https://futureoflife.org/bai-2017/) conference, [Jürgen Schmidhuber](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/) predicted on 7 January 2017 in a panel discussion about creating human-level AI that it would happen before his retirement, which would be 2028 under the current swiss law, but could be postponed in the event of a law change. The discussion's [video recording](https://youtu.be/V0aXMTpZTfc?t=6m54s) was published on 9 Feb 2017. He later explained in a [Guardian report](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/apr/18/robot-man-artificial-intelligence-computer-milky-way) on 18 April 2017 that his company [Nnaisense](https://nnaisense.com/) was already developing systems that function like babies. They are too slow, but assuming hardware progress of 10 times faster every five years, he said it would "only take 25 years" to have a neural net comparable with the human brain. He reiterated in an [IEEE report](http://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/software/humanlevel-ai-is-right-around-the-corner-or-hundreds-of-years-away#JurgenSchmidhuber) on 31 May 2017 that "soon" we'd have cheap devices with the raw computational power of a human brain.

### Ray Kurzweil

Ray [Kurzweil](http://www.kurzweilai.net/) predicted in his 2005 book [The Singularity Is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology](http://singularity.com/) that strong AI would emerge around 2029. He has kept his prediction since then, and in an [IEEE report](http://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/software/humanlevel-ai-is-right-around-the-corner-or-hundreds-of-years-away#RayKurzweil) on 31 May 2017, reiterated his belief that computer would exceed human capabilities by 2029.

### Nick Bostrom

As of [31 May 2017](http://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/software/humanlevel-ai-is-right-around-the-corner-or-hundreds-of-years-away#NickBostrom), the notion that we could have human-level AI within a small number of decades seemed reasonable to Nick Bostrom.

### Gary Marcus

As of [31 May 2017](http://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/software/humanlevel-ai-is-right-around-the-corner-or-hundreds-of-years-away#GaryMarcus), Gary thought it could still be 20 to 50 years before machines can be as fluent as people in a few cognitive areas.
