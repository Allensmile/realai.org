# Timing

## Expert Predictions

### Jürgen Schmidhuber

[Jürgen Schmidhuber](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/) explained in a [Guardian report](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/apr/18/robot-man-artificial-intelligence-computer-milky-way) on 18 April 2017 that his company [Nnaisense](https://nnaisense.com/) was already developing systems that function like babies. They are too slow, but assuming hardware progress of 10 times faster every five years, he said it would "only take 25 years" to have a neural net comparable with the human brain. He reiterated in an [IEEE report](http://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/software/humanlevel-ai-is-right-around-the-corner-or-hundreds-of-years-away#JurgenSchmidhuber) on 31 May 2017 that "soon" we'd have cheap devices with the raw computational power of a human brain.

### Ray Kurzweil

As of [31 May 2017](http://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/software/humanlevel-ai-is-right-around-the-corner-or-hundreds-of-years-away#RayKurzweil), he believed that computer will exceed human capabilities by 2029.

### Nick Bostrom

As of [31 May 2017](http://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/software/humanlevel-ai-is-right-around-the-corner-or-hundreds-of-years-away#NickBostrom), the notion that we could have human-level AI within a small number of decades seemed reasonable to Nick Bostrom.

### Gary Marcus

As of [31 May 2017](http://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/software/humanlevel-ai-is-right-around-the-corner-or-hundreds-of-years-away#GaryMarcus), Gary thought it could still be 20 to 50 years before machines can be as fluent as people in a few cognitive areas.
