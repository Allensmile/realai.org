# Intrinsic Motivation

[Florensa et al. (2017)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.03012) designed a single proxy reward that encodes the prior about useful high level bahaviors, then combined Stochastic Neural Networks with mutual information to encourage diversity of skills.

There are many ([Oudeyer & Kaplan, 2008](http://www.lucs.lu.se/LUCS/139/oudeyer.pdf)) intrinsic motivations, some commonly used ones include:

* Empowerment
* [Exploration](http://realai.org/exploration/)
* Mutual Information
* [Prediction](http://realai.org/predictive-learning/)
