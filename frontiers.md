# Frontiers

It is entirely possible that breakthroughs towards AGI will come from areas other than deep learning. We will carefully monitor progress in all relevant fields, including futuristic theories such as quantum consciousness ([Penrose 1989](https://www.amazon.com/Emperors-New-Mind-Concerning-Computers/dp/0192861980)).
