# Frontiers

It is entirely possible that breakthroughs towards AGI will come from areas other than deep learning. We will monitor progress in all relevant fields, including futuristic theories such as quantum consciousness ([Penrose 1989](https://www.amazon.com/Emperors-New-Mind-Concerning-Computers/dp/0192861980)).

Non-deep learning theories of machine intelligence:

* [Feynman Machine](https://hackernoon.com/feynman-machine-a-new-approach-for-cortical-and-machine-intelligence-5855c0e61a70) ([Laukien et al. 2016](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.03971))
* [Hierarchical Temporal Memory](http://numenta.org/) ([Hawkins et al., 2016](http://numenta.com/biological-and-machine-intelligence/))
* [NARS (Non-Axiomatic Reasoning System)](https://sites.google.com/site/narswang/home)

#### OpenCog

[OpenCog](http://wiki.opencog.org/w/The_Open_Cognition_Project) is an open-source development effort for the CogPrime approach to AGI, which is based on the idea that human level intelligence can emerge from integrating multiple learning systems and memory components in an appropriate architecture and environment. CogPrime is a comprehensive architecture that contains more than two dozens of cognitive processes such as procedure repository, associative episodic memory, backup store, spacetime server, world simulation, etc. All these cognitive processes operate by observing and modifying certain Atoms in the Atomspace, which is also a cognitive process that models high-level mind architecture and working memory. A conceptual depiction of CogPrime is provided in Fig. 2.1 of [Goertzel et al. (2014)](http://www.springer.com/gp/book/9789462390263), who point out that the human brain appears to be an integration of algorithms and structures honed by evolution to inter-adapt, and believe that the main missing ingredient in AI is to *design* this cognitive synergy. The emphasis here is to note that in the CogPrime approach, the synergy is supposed to be designed instead of learned.
