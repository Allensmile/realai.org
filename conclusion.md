# Conclusion

Research in AGI is progressing rapidly, and its creation is getting closer every day. AGI can bring enormous benefits to humanity, but could also spell disaster if not properly developed. Given its imminence and potential impact, the field deserves a lot more attention from the society.

Many things can be done today to [positively shape the development](https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/positively-shaping-artificial-intelligence/) of AGI, such as research, policy, advocacy and capacity building. There are organizations around the world that could effectively use additional human and financial resources. For people who feel the urgency or are willing to contribute, there are also many opportunities, from small donations to lifetime career changes. With hard work and caution, we believe that when singularity comes, it's not going to be a disaster. It's going to be the next level of civilization. In this new world, everyone can live well and prosper.
