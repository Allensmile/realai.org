# Effective Altruism

## History

Inspired by the ideas of ethicists Peter Singer and Thomas Pogge, [Toby Ord](http://www.tobyord.com/) decided in 2009 to commit a large proportion of his income to charities that effectively alleviate poverty in the developing world. In November, he and Will MacAskill launched Giving What We Can ([history](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/about-us/history/)), an international organization of people who would donate a significant proportion of their income to cost-effective charities.

80,000 Hours ([about](https://80000hours.org/about/)) was officially launched at Oxford in November 2011, after Ben and Will MacAskill did their own research on what to do with their own careers.
