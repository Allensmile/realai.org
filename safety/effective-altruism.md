# Effective Altruism

Effective altruism (EA), as currently ([28 April 2017](https://www.centreforeffectivealtruism.org/what-is-effective-altruism/)) understood by the Centre for Effective Altruism, "is about using evidence and reason to figure out how to benefit others as much as possible, and taking action on that basis." As explained in an 80,000 Hours [blog post](https://80000hours.org/2012/03/what-is-an-effective-altruist/) on 5 March 2012, shortly after the term was fixed, altruism means helping others, and instead of just doing what feels right, effective altruists pause a moment and think about what will work best, and then do it.

## History

[Peter Singer](http://www.petersinger.info/)([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Singer); [Twitter](https://twitter.com/PeterSinger)), an influential contemporary philosopher, published [The Life You Can Save: Acting Now To End World Poverty](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0812981561/) in March 2009 that advocated smarter giving in philanthropy.

Inspired by the ideas of ethicists Peter and Thomas Pogge, [Toby Ord](http://www.tobyord.com/) decided in 2009 to commit a large proportion of his income to charities that effectively alleviate poverty in the developing world. In November, he and [Will MacAskill](http://www.williammacaskill.com/) ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_MacAskill); [Twitter](https://twitter.com/willmacaskill)) launched Giving What We Can ([history](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/about-us/history/)), an international organization of people who would donate a significant proportion of their income to cost-effective charities.

80,000 Hours ([about](https://80000hours.org/about/)) was officially launched at Oxford in November 2011, after Ben and Will MacAskill did their own research on what to do with their own careers. It moved the focus in Oxford away from just charity and onto ethical life-optimisation more generally.

In March 2013, Peter filmed [The Why and How of Effective Altruism](https://www.ted.com/talks/peter_singer_the_why_and_how_of_effective_altruism), a TED talk that has since attracted 1.5 million views. During the same year, Charlie Bresler, formerly president of The Men’s Wearhouse, provided funding to turn the organization The Life You Can Save ([about](https://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/About-Us)) into a registered 501c3 charity.
