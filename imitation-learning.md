# Imitation Learning

Imitation learning is when a learning architecture is trained to mimic behaviors, usually human demonstrations.

## Observational Learning

In observational learning, a student agent can observe a teacher agent, but is not required to learn anything from it. It is not considered imitation learning, although it would be nice to have an experiment where imitation learning emerges from the availability of observations. In simple scenarios where a student agent seeks a sometimes hidden goal, [Borsa et al. (2017)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.06617) demonstrate that a reinforcement learning agent can distill useful information contained in observed teacher behavior, and learns useful policies such as seeking the teacher then simply following it to the goal.
