# Impacts

On this page, we disuss the likely impacts of AGI.

## Academic Research

The empirical success of deep learning changed the thinking in many related disciplines such as [image processing](https://sinews.siam.org/Details-Page/deep-deep-trouble) where researchers had mixed feelings of disgust and envy towards the trend. They pondered whether they should insist on their old, more rigorous ways of research or pivot to deep learning that lacked mathematical elegance and offered very little interprepretability of the solutions or understanding of the underlying data.

## Jobs

[Harari (2017)](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/may/08/virtual-reality-religion-robots-sapiens-book) predicted that within decades AI would outperform humans in most jobs, causing large number of people to become unemployable. The unemployed masses would be kept occupied and content by virtual reality games.
