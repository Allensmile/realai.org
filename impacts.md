[Harari (2017)](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/may/08/virtual-reality-religion-robots-sapiens-book) predicted that within decades AI would outperform humans in most jobs, causing large number of people to become unemployable. The unemployed masses would be kept occupied and content by virtual reality games.
