# Impacts

Opinions from influential people [diverge](http://www.agreelist.org/s/advanced-artificial-intelligenc-4mtqyes0jrqy) on whether advanced AI will pose a serious risk to society within the next 50 years. Below we discuss in more details the likely impacts of AGI.

## Public Administration

It is conceivable that blackbox AI algorithms could be employed to make important decisions in the public sector. [ACLU reported in June 2017](https://www.aclu.org/blog/free-future/pitfalls-artificial-intelligence-decisionmaking-highlighted-idaho-aclu-case) that it was involved in an old Idaho case for the past several years where the amounts of assistance from Medicaid were assessed using Excel spreadsheet that lacked transparency.

## Jobs

[Harari (2017)](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/may/08/virtual-reality-religion-robots-sapiens-book) predicted that within decades AI would outperform humans in most jobs, causing large number of people to become unemployable. The unemployed masses would be kept occupied and content by virtual reality games.

## Academic Research

The empirical success of deep learning changed the thinking in many related disciplines such as [image processing](https://sinews.siam.org/Details-Page/deep-deep-trouble) where researchers had mixed feelings of disgust and envy towards the trend. They pondered whether they should insist on their old, more rigorous ways of research or pivot to deep learning that lacked mathematical elegance and offered very little interprepretability of the solutions or understanding of the underlying data.

## Dangers

[Adam (2017)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.05143) warns that recent advances in machine learning has made it "possible to unleash incredibly powerful, human-like armies of social bots, in potentially well coordinated campaigns of deception and influence."
