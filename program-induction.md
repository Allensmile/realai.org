# Program Induction

The capability of inducing programs is a key to solving AI.

[Neelakantan et al. (2015)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.04834) proposed *Neural Programmer*, a neural network augmented with discrete operations that can be trained end-to-end. The model performed well on a synthetic dataset, and was enhanced in [Neelakantan et al. (2016)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.08945) to map natural language queries to executable programs on a database.
