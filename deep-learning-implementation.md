# Deep Learning Implementation

## Software

* [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) is an open-source software library for machine intelligence.
* [Keras](https://keras.io/) is a deep Learning library for Theano and TensorFlow.
* [Sonnet](https://github.com/deepmind/sonnet) is a library built on top of TensorFlow for building complex neural networks.
* [MXNet](http://mxnet.io/) is a flexible and efficient library for deep learning.
* [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org/) is a deep learning framework that puts Python first. This [repository](https://github.com/yunjey/pytorch-tutorial) provides tutorial code.
* [rllab](https://github.com/openai/rllab) is a framework for developing and evaluating reinforcement learning algorithms.

## Hardware
