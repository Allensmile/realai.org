# Multi-Agent Learning

## Communication

Low channel bandwith pressures agents to communicate in a language with high information content. For this communication to be effective, agents should build objective internal models of the environment. In this sense, a successful language among independent agents is a powerful regularizer that reduces overfitting, and helps the agents to develop "common sense". This is a promising line of research towards language grounding.

Language can emerge as a means for agents to collaborate, communicating in discrete actions ([Foerster, Assael et al., 2016](https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.06676)) or continuous vectors ([Sukhbaatar et al., 2016](https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07736)). The emergent language can be made more interpretable by making changes to the game environment ([Lazaridou et al., 2016](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.07182)), and can exhibit basic compositional structure ([Mordatch & Abbeel, 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.04908)).
