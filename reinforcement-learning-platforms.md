# Learning Platforms

A learning platform is an environment in which an agent can observe, act, and learn. [DeepMind Lab](https://github.com/deepmind/lab) is a 3D learning environment based on the [Quake III Arena](https://github.com/id-Software/Quake-III-Arena). Facebook's [TorchCraft](https://github.com/TorchCraft/TorchCraft) is a bridge between Torch and StarCraft. Microsoft's [Project Malmö](https://github.com/Microsoft/malmo) is built on top of Minecraft. [VizDoom](https://github.com/mwydmuch/ViZDoom) is based on [ZDoom](https://github.com/rheit/zdoom) that allows AI bots to play using only the screen buffer.

Microsoft's [Aerial Informatics and Robotics Platform](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/aerial-informatics-robotics-platform/) is an open-source, high-fidelity physics and photo-realistic robot simulator.

[OpenAI Gym](https://gym.openai.com/) supports teaching agents everything from walking to playing games like Pong or Go. OpenAI's [Universe](https://universe.openai.com/) is a software platform for measuring and training AI acrosss many games, websites and other applications.
