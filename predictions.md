# Predictions

Below is a list of milestones we forecast to be achieved based on our current understanding of progress in deep learning. The list will be updated continuously as the field progresses. The timing is intended to be **conservative**, that is, we expect to constantly adjust to earlier times as the field has advanced faster than our expectation since 2012:

* 2023. An advanced math theorem is proved by a deep learning-based AI system. The system generates a proof in logical symbols whose correctness can be easily verified, but the proof is very difficult for professional mathematicians to understand.
* 2027. Announcement from major labs that AGI is created.
