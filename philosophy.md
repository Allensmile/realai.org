[Pereira (2017)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.03078) introduced the Super-Strong Self-Sampling Assumption (SSSSA) that human consciousness should be a typical sample in the consciousness-space-time. He then concluded that superintelligent AI would probably not be created because otherwise it would dominate the consciousness-space-time.
