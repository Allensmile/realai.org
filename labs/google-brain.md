# Google Brain

[Google Brain](https://research.google.com/teams/brain/) is a research team that aims to make machines intelligent and improve peopleâ€™s lives. Most of the team is based in Mountain View, but there are smaller groups of team members in Cambridge (Massachusetts), London, Montreal, New York, San Francisco, Toronto and Zurich.

On 12 March 2013, Google acquired DNNresearch, a startup founded by University of Toronto's professor Geoffrey Hinton and two of his grad students ([TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2013/03/12/google-scoops-up-neural-networks-startup-dnnresearch-to-boost-its-voice-and-image-search-tech/), [VentureBeat](http://venturebeat.com/2013/03/12/google-dnnresearch/)).

The [Google Brain Residency Program](https://research.google.com/teams/brain/residency/) was launched in October 2015. It is a 12-month role based in Mountain View, California. The first group of residents arrived in June 2016.
