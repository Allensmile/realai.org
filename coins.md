After [surging for days](http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-02-27/ethereum-soars-after-jpmorgan-intel-microsoft-and-others-form-blockchain-alliance) in the end of February 2017, it was later  [reported](http://in.reuters.com/article/ethereum-enterprises-consortium-idINKBN16717C) and [announced](http://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/computing/networks/enterprise-ethereum-alliance-launches) that the [Enterprise Ethereum Alliance](https://entethalliance.org/) (EEA) was formed to develop technology based on Ethereum. EEA’s founders include more than two dozens companies including JPMorgan, Microsoft, and Intel.

On 30 May 2017, Ethereum [had higher 24-hour trading volume](https://cointelegraph.com/news/ethereum-has-higher-trade-volumes-than-bitcoin-as-fortunes-reverse) than Bitcoin’s, and [rose to more than 50% of Bitcoin’s market cap](https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/ethereum-market-cap-rises-to-more-than-50-of-bitcoins/).

## Exchanges

There are [dozens of](https://www.cryptocoincharts.info/markets/info) of cryptocurrency exchanges. On 7-8 May 2017, San Francisco-based [Kraken](https://www.kraken.com/) and Delaware-based [Poloniex](https://poloniex.com/) experienced DDoS attacks during which a large Ethereum sell order caused many leveraged positions to be liquidated. The Cointelegraph [reported on 15 May 2017](https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-exchanges-kraken-poloniex-to-be-scrutinized-for-possible-insider-trading-manipulation) that these exchanges were being scrutinized by a law firm.

Prices of the same coin can vary widely on different exchanges. The discrepancy can be easily seen on [an OKCoin comparison page](https://www.okcoin.com/marketList.html) for BTC and LTC. There are good reasons for this apparent lack of arbitrage. For example, between April and May 2017, Crypto/USD pairs [went from premium to discount](https://medium.com/@Austerity_Sucks/why-bitfinex-went-from-a-premium-in-its-crypto-usd-pairs-to-now-a-significant-discount-e7be193d7cb0) on Bitfinex, an exchange that was [hacked in August 2016](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitfinex_hack).

## Initial Coin Offerings

On 31 May 2017, Brave's ethereum-based [Basic Attention Token](https://basicattentiontoken.org/) (BAT) raised about [$35 million in 30 seconds](http://www.coindesk.com/35-million-30-seconds-token-sale-internet-browser-brave-sells/). The project was [launched in late March](http://www.coindesk.com/web-browser-brave-to-launch-ico-for-ethereum-ad-token/). By 3 June 2017, BAT had a market cap of more than $160 million, according to [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/assets/basic-attention-token/).

[TrueBit](https://truebit.io/) claims to be a scalable verification solution for blockchains. According to its [whitepaper](https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~teutsch/papers/truebit.pdf), it has a dispute resolution layer that takes the form of a verification game.

## Decentralized Computation

The [Ethereum](https://www.ethereum.org/) network faces the problem of scalability as its protocol requires all miners to verify computations, known as the Verifier's Dilemma ([Luu et al., 2015](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2813659)). Solutions have been proposed include Golem ([Whitepaper](https://golem.network/doc/Golemwhitepaper.pdf)) and [Truebit](https://truebit.io/) ([Whitepaper](https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~teutsch/papers/truebit.pdf)). The latter was included as part of a proposed [dApp developer stack](https://medium.com/@FEhrsam/the-dapp-developer-stack-the-blockchain-industry-barometer-8d55ec1c7d4). In May 2017, [EOS](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/ethereum-killer-here-eos-enterprise-scale-operating-sanjay-mehta) was proposed as another solution to the scalability problem.

## Steem

[Steem](https://steem.io/) is a blockchain-based [social media platform](https://steemit.com/) where [anyone](https://steemd.com/) can earn [rewards](https://steemwhales.com/). According to its [white paper](https://steem.io/SteemWhitePaper.pdf), it has a *subjective* Proof of Work system that allows a community to be built around any concept that has a sufficiently defined purpose.

According to a July 2016 post by [dan](https://steemit.com/@dan), Steemit's [evil plan](https://steemit.com/steem/@dan/steemit-s-evil-plan-for-cryptocurrency-world-domination) is bootstrapping a digital currency.
