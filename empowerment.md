# Empowerment

Empowerment is a form of [intrinsic motivation](http://realai.org/intrinsic-motivation). Informally, it measures an agent's ability to affect its environment. It was formally defined in [Salge et al. (2013)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1310.1863) as the maximum of mutual information between the agent's action and its future perceptions. It is related to causal entropic force ([Wissner-Gross & Freer, 2013](http://math.mit.edu/~freer/papers/PhysRevLett_110-168702.pdf)), a theory of intelligence based in physics.
