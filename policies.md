### Universal Basic Income

In May 2017, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg called for universal basic income ([CNBC](http://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/25/mark-zuckerberg-calls-for-universal-basic-income-at-harvard-speech.html)) to give everyone a cushion to try new ideas, during his [Harvard Commencement speech](http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2017/05/mark-zuckerbergs-speech-as-written-for-harvards-class-of-2017/). The call was [echoed a few days later](https://www.geek.com/tech-science-3/elon-musk-automation-will-force-universal-basic-income-1701217/) by Elon Musk at the World Government Summit in Dubai. Yuval Noah Harari wrote in an [opinion piece on Bloomberg View](https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-06-04/universal-basic-income-is-neither-universal-nor-basic) that universal basic income (UBI) was neither universal nor basic. UBI initiatives were national or municipal, and it was unclear how to define "basic".

In an empirical study, [Marinescu (2017)](http://rooseveltinstitute.org/no-strings-attached/) found that unconditional cash transfers significantly raised recipients' quality of life, and caused at most a moderate descrease in labor participation.
